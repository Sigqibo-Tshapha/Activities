Hey, this is the git repository where I did the 2 activities you sent me. Hit me up on 0732190693 if theres anything you need clarity on and
feel free to modify any of the code...most lecturers/ tutors have their own preferences so just make sure you set this up to yours. Most of the questions were quite vague but then again you can make any of this code more specific to your understanding.
